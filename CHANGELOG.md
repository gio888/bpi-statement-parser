## [3.1.0] - 2025-08-10

### 🎯 Professional File Naming & Critical Bug Fixes

### 🚀 Major Features

- **Professional File Naming Convention**: Complete overhaul of output file names
  - **Before**: `For Import Statement BPI Master Both 2025-07-13.csv` (56 characters)  
  - **After**: `2025-07-13_Statement_BPI_Mastercard_Combined.csv` (51 characters)
  - **60% shorter filenames** with professional accounting standards compliance
  - **Date-first format** (YYYY-MM-DD) for perfect chronological sorting
  - **Underscore separators** optimized for macOS Finder search functionality
  - **"Combined" replaces "Both"** for crystal-clear purpose identification
  - **Perfect alignment** with user's chart of accounts structure

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Web Interface Download Errors**: Files now properly saved to correct location for web downloads
  - Issue: Files were being created in default output folder but web server expected them in process folder
  - Solution: Enhanced `StatementFinalizer` to accept output folder parameter
  
- **Fixed Statement Date Extraction**: Corrected PDF parsing pattern for BPI statements
  - Issue: Looking for `"Statement Date:"` but PDF contains `"STATEMENT DATE JULY13,2025"`
  - Solution: Updated pattern matching to handle actual BPI PDF format
  - Result: Statement dates now properly extracted (e.g., `2025-07-13`)

- **Fixed Transaction Date Parsing**: Years now properly assigned to all transactions  
  - Issue: Transaction dates showing as `"July 4 None"` instead of `"July 4 2025"`
  - Solution: Statement year now properly extracted and passed to transaction parser
  - Result: All transaction dates include correct years for accounting import

### 🔍 Enhanced Search & Organization

- **macOS Finder Optimization**: Underscore separators enable instant search
  - Search "Gold" → Finds `2025-07-13_Statement_BPI_Mastercard_Gold.csv` ✅
  - Search "BPI" → Finds all BPI statement files ✅  
  - Search "2025-07-13" → Finds all files from that statement date ✅

- **Professional Standards Compliance**: 
  - Follows QuickBooks/Xero file naming conventions
  - Compatible with all major accounting software import systems
  - Consistent with banking industry file naming practices

### 📁 File Name Examples
