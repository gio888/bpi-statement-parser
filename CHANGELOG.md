# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-06-07

### üöÄ Major Features Added
- **Statement Date-Based File Naming**: CSV files now use actual statement dates instead of processing timestamps
- **Cross-Year Transaction Handling**: December transactions in January statements correctly assigned to previous year
- **Single PDF Mode**: Fixed and enhanced single PDF processing through main menu system
- **Intelligent Year Extraction**: Automatic year detection from PDF filenames for accurate transaction dating

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Smart File Naming**:
  - Single PDF: `For Import Statement BPI Master BPI_ECREDIT_CARD 2025-01-12.csv`
  - Batch processing: `For Import Statement BPI Master BPI_ECREDIT_CARD 2024-01-14 to 2025-05-12.csv`
- **Cross-Year Logic**: December transactions in January statements automatically get previous year (e.g., December 2024 transactions in January 2025 statement)
- **Year-Aware Processing**: All transaction dates now use correct years extracted from statement filenames

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Transaction Parser**: Added intelligent year determination with cross-year support
- **Fixed Single PDF Mode**: Replaced broken import with working implementation using existing modules
- **Improved Date Handling**: Year extraction from filename patterns (Statement BPI Master YYYY-MM-DD.pdf)
- **Statement Date Propagation**: Pass statement dates through processing pipeline for accurate file naming

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Year Assignment**: Transactions now get correct years from statement dates instead of current system year
- **Fixed Single PDF Processing**: Resolved import error that prevented single PDF mode from working
- **Fixed Cross-Year Edge Case**: December statements (e.g., 2024-12-12) now correctly keep their own year instead of previous year
- **Fixed File Naming**: Output files now reflect actual statement periods instead of processing timestamps

### üìÅ Enhanced Output System
**Before v2.1.0**: Files named with processing timestamp
```
For Import Statement BPI Master BPI_ECREDIT_CARD 2025-06-07 1630.csv
```

**After v2.1.0**: Files named with statement date(s)
```
Single PDF: For Import Statement BPI Master BPI_ECREDIT_CARD 2025-01-12.csv
Batch: For Import Statement BPI Master BPI_ECREDIT_CARD 2024-01-14 to 2025-05-12.csv
```

### üéØ Cross-Year Intelligence
- **January Statements**: December transactions automatically assigned to previous year
- **December Statements**: December transactions correctly keep the statement year
- **Accurate Dating**: Eliminates manual date corrections for year-end processing

### üí° User Experience Improvements
- **Meaningful File Names**: Easy identification of statement periods from file names
- **Better Organization**: Files naturally sort by statement date instead of processing date
- **Reduced Manual Work**: No more year corrections for cross-year transactions
- **Working Single PDF Mode**: All processing modes now fully functional

### ‚öôÔ∏è Module Updates
- **statement_finalizer.py**: Enhanced with statement date parameter and intelligent file naming
- **transaction_parser.py**: Added cross-year logic and year determination methods
- **batch_processor.py**: Updated to pass statement dates to finalizer
- **main_enhanced.py**: Fixed single PDF mode with proper year extraction
- **currency_handler.py**: Enhanced to handle pre-formatted dates with years

### üîÑ Workflow Enhancements
**Improved Processing Pipeline**:
1. Extract year from PDF filename (Statement BPI Master 2025-01-12.pdf ‚Üí 2025)
2. Apply cross-year logic (December transactions in January statements ‚Üí previous year)
3. Generate meaningful output file names using actual statement dates
4. Support both single PDF and batch processing with consistent naming

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
None - All existing functionality enhanced while maintaining backward compatibility

### üß™ Testing Improvements
- Verified cross-year logic with January 2025 statements containing December 2024 transactions
- Tested statement date extraction from various filename formats
- Validated single PDF processing workflow end-to-end
